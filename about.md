## What is this?

I am the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) "Oceanic" theme. A minimalist theme
with a blue tint that provides an easy-to-read layout for blogs.

I am customizable for different preferences, and support pagination and archive
pages for blog tags/categories.

## What is this place?

This is an example site for the Oceanic theme. You are welcome to navigate the
site and take a look. There isn't much content here, but there should be enough
to give you an impression of the template, and whether or not you'd want to use
it and/or customize it for your needs.

## How do I get it?

You can head on over to [Github](https://github.com/karlnicoll/jekyll-oceanic)
for installation instructions, or to browse the template's code.

## Am I allowed to use it?

Yes! The `jekyll-oceanic` code over on Github is licensed under the
[MIT license](https://github.com/karlnicoll/jekyll-oceanic/blob/master/LICENSE).
This means that you can use the code however you want, as long
as you include a copy of the MIT license with your own code.
