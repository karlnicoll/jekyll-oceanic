<p>
  This is a sample blog. The posts are all taken from the minima template and
  should give you an idea of what text looks like. Feel free to take a look
  around.
</p>
<p>
  The pagination is done using the
  <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll-paginate-v2">
    jekyll-paginate-v2 plugin
  </a>, which is fully supported by the template. The paginator is only
  configured for 2 posts per page so that you can see the paginator at the
  bottom of the page. This can be increased easily by changing the
  <code>per_page</code> paginator configuration setting.
